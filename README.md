# Guess the Number — Python Game

This is a simple interactive Python game created for the "Foundations of Programming and Software Engineering" module (Assessment 2). The game demonstrates the use of Python fundamentals, user input, loops, functions, and basic error handling.

## 🎮 How the Game Works
- The computer randomly chooses a number between **1 and 100**.
- The player must guess the number.
- After each guess, the game gives feedback:
  - **"Too high!"**
  - **"Too low!"**
  - **"Correct!"**
- It also keeps track of how many guesses the player has made.
